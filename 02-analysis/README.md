# Analysis Phase

This folder holds all thermal calculations, baseline assessments, and performance simulations for the solid wall retrofit.

## Contents

- **`baseline-conditions.md`**: Description of the existing wall construction, material layers, and initial U‑value.
- **`thermal-bridge-analysis.md`**: Identification and quantification of critical thermal bridges introduced by the retrofit, with proposed mitigation measures.
- **`performance-calculation.md`**: Simplified heat‑loss calculations comparing the original wall with the retrofitted assembly.

## Methodology

- U‑values calculated using standard steady‑state formula: U = 1 / (Rsi + R1 + R2 + … + Rse).
- Thermal bridge ψ‑values (psi‑values) taken from typical construction details (e.g., PHPP guidelines).
- Passivhaus criteria: space heating demand ≤ 15 kWh/(m²a) and specific heat load ≤ 10 W/m².

## Tools

- Passive House Planning Package (PHPP)
- AECB Low Energy Building Planning Package (LEBPP)
- Manual calculations as a cross‑check
