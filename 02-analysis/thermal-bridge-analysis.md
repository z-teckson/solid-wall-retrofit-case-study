# Thermal Bridge Analysis

## Introduction

Adding external insulation to a solid wall introduces new thermal bridges at junctions with other building elements. This document identifies two critical bridges and proposes mitigation strategies.

## 1. Eaves Junction

### Description

The insulation layer meets the roof eaves, where the roof structure (rafters, fascia) can create a localised heat‑loss path.

### Existing Condition

- Brickwork continues into the eaves soffit; no insulation continuity.
- Timber rafter ends embedded in wall act as conductive bridges.

### Proposed Retrofit

- Insulation wrapped up and over the eaves, continuing into the roof‑plane insulation (if accessible).
- Use of insulated soffit panels or continuous insulation behind fascia.
- Thermal break between rafter ends and wall using low‑conductivity spacers.

### Psi‑value (ψ)

Typical ψ‑value for an insulated eaves junction with external insulation: **0.08 W/mK** (based on PHPP component library).

## 2. Internal Floor‑Slab Junction

### Description

Where the external wall meets an intermediate timber or concrete floor slab, the slab can bypass the insulation layer.

### Existing Condition

- Floor joists or slab bear directly on the inner leaf of the solid wall.
- No insulation at the perimeter.

### Proposed Retrofit

- Insulation extended down to below the floor level, forming a ‘skirt’ around the slab edge.
- For timber floors, insulation packed between joist ends with an airtight seal.
- For concrete floors, perimeter insulation board (e.g., EPS) inserted between slab and wall.

### Psi‑value (ψ)

Typical ψ‑value for an insulated floor‑slab junction: **0.10 W/mK** (assuming 100 mm insulation wrap).

## Impact on Overall Heat Loss

Psi‑values are multiplied by the linear length of each junction to obtain additional heat loss. For a typical two‑storey house:

- Eaves length: 20 m × 0.08 W/mK = **1.6 W/K**.
- Floor‑slab length: 20 m × 0.10 W/mK = **2.0 W/K**.

These losses must be added to the area‑based heat loss (U × A) when assessing Passivhaus compliance.

## Mitigation Priority

1. Ensure insulation continuity at all junctions.
2. Use proprietary insulation blocks or pre‑formed thermal‑break components where possible.
3. Detail airtightness layer to follow the warm side of the insulation, sealing all gaps.
