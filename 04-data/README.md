# Data Repository

This folder stores raw material specifications, cost estimates, and calculation inputs/outputs.

## Contents

- **`materials.csv`**: Table of proposed insulation materials, thicknesses, conductivity values, and approximate costs.
- **`cost-breakdown.md`** (optional): Itemised cost estimate for the retrofit.
- **`calculation-inputs.md`** (optional): Input parameters used in the thermal calculations (climate data, internal temperatures, etc.).

## Data Sources

- Material thermal conductivities from manufacturer technical data sheets.
- Typical psi‑values from Passivhaus component databases.
- Cost data based on UK market rates (2025).

## Usage

- The CSV file can be imported into spreadsheet software for further analysis.
- All data is provided in SI units (metres, W/mK, £/m²).
