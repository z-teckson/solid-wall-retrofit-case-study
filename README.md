# Solid Wall Retrofit Case Study

A complete open-source case study for deep retrofit of a solid brick wall to meet Passivhaus standard.

## Project Overview

This repository documents a systematic approach to retrofitting a typical solid brick wall (common in pre-1920s housing) to achieve the thermal performance requirements of the Passivhaus standard. The case study simulates a professional project workflow, including planning, analysis, construction detailing, and performance validation.

## Repository Structure

- **`/01-planning`**: Project scope, objectives, and initial decisions.
- **`/02-analysis`**: Thermal calculations, baseline conditions, thermal bridge analysis, and performance simulations.
- **`/03-construction-details`**: Drawings, specifications, and construction sequencing for the proposed retrofit.
- **`/04-data`**: Material specifications, cost data, and raw calculation inputs/outputs.

## Key Objectives

1. **Baseline Assessment**: Document the existing wall construction and its thermal performance (U‑value ≈ 2.1 W/m²K).
2. **Retrofit Design**: Select an insulation system that brings the wall to Passivhaus levels (U‑value ≤ 0.15 W/m²K).
3. **Thermal Bridge Mitigation**: Identify and detail critical junctions (eaves, floor slab, reveals) to minimise heat loss.
4. **Performance Verification**: Demonstrate the improvement through simplified heat‑loss calculations and compare with Passivhaus criteria.

## Tools & Standards

- **Passivhaus Standard** (PHPP)
- **AECB Low Energy Building Planning Package (LEBPP)**
- Thermal bridge analysis using ψ‑values (psi‑values)
- Typical material conductivity values from manufacturers
