# Planning Phase

This folder contains documents related to project planning and initial decisions for the solid wall retrofit.

## Contents

- **Project Scope**: Defines the boundaries of the retrofit, including which wall elements are considered.
- **Objectives**: Lists the performance targets, e.g., achieving Passivhaus standard U‑value ≤ 0.15 W/m²K.
- **Initial Surveys**: Notes on existing building condition, moisture risks, and structural constraints.
- **Decision Log**: Records key choices (e.g., insulation type, thickness, detailing approach) with rationale.

## Workflow

1. Review baseline data in `/02-analysis/baseline-conditions.md`.
2. Select insulation system based on thermal performance, cost, and buildability.
3. Develop construction details (see `/03-construction-details`).
4. Validate with thermal bridge analysis and performance calculations.

*Note: This is a simulated case study; actual project planning would include client briefs, regulatory checks, and site‑specific risk assessments.*
