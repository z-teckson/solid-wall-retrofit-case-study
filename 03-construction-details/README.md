# Construction Details

This folder contains sketches, specifications, and sequencing guidance for building the proposed retrofit.

## Contents

- **Wall section drawings** showing the existing brickwork, new insulation layer, and finishes.
- **Junction details** for eaves, floor‑slab connections, window reveals, and other critical interfaces.
- **Material installation notes** (e.g., adhesive application, fastener spacing, vapour‑control layer placement).
- **Airtightness detailing** to meet Passivhaus requirements.

## Key Principles

1. **Continuity of insulation**: Avoid gaps or compression at junctions.
2. **Airtightness layer**: Located on the warm side of the insulation, taped and sealed at all penetrations.
3. **Moisture management**: Ensure vapour‑open exterior finish or incorporate a ventilated cavity where appropriate.
4. **Buildability**: Details should be practical for on‑site trades with typical skill levels.

*Note: These are illustrative details; actual construction should be designed by a qualified professional.*
